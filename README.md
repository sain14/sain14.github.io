#    My Data Analytics projects

# Certification: Google Data Analytics Professional (GDAP) certificate course

# INTRODUCTION:
This repository is for projects I have done using various data analysis tools like Spreadsheets, Structured Query Language (SQL), Tableau, Python and R.
These projects deal with real life problems which I have tried to solve using large public datasets from Kaggle, The World Bank, data.world, etc.
I have cleaned and organized the data, uncovered patterns and trends, drawn meaningful insights, presented them through various visualization softwares and provided recommendations as solutions to the problem statements.
