#   TITLE: EMPLOYEE ATTRITION PROJECT

#  INTRODUCTION:
The dataset is taken from Atlas Labs. It contains detailed information about the present as well as former employees of the company. I have used the data to perform analsysis in SQL to find out how certain factors affect the reason why people quit the company. It would help in understanding if there are any patterns in the attrition and if the company can make any changes to better their work environment.
#  OBJECTIVES:
1. Impact of age and company loyalty on attrition rate
2. Salary range and its impact if any
3. Company loyalty and its consequence
4. Check how attrition rates differ in the three departments of Sales, Human Resources and Technology
#  TECH STACK USED:
# > SQL
# > EXCEL
#  CONCLUSION:
The overview, insights and recommendations have been organized in a powerpoint presentation with added visual aids.
